# FoxitTabSessionSaveAndRestore

This is bascially an improvement of a script published by https://github.com/futurevaigyanik which can be found here: https://github.com/futurevaigyanik/FoxitAutoHotkey (https://futurevaigyanik.wordpress.com/2013/06/05/backup-foxit-pdf-reader-session-using-autohotkey-script/ for a more detailed description). It's a AutoHotKey-program which allows tabs/sessions to be saved and restored in Foxit. This works by extracting the registry-information written by Foxit.

I updated it to Foxit PDF Editor 11, where they changed the behaviour of stored sessions. It is now a bit more complicated but it should be doable. You just need to tick one additional option when saving a registry. 

A problem I could not solve is that by AHK-script seems to stop working when I change the Windows-Virtual Desktops. MAybe someone has a solution for that :)

Anyways, I hope this program help you and makes your life easier.
